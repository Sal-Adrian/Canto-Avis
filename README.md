# Canto Avis
Canto Avis is a music player for bird sounds using [Xeno-Canto](https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api)'s API. I enjoy the recordings on Xeno-Canto, but there isn't an option to consecutively play the recording in the background, so I made this.

The website is [HERE](https://sal-adrian.github.io/Canto-Avis/).

## Server Version:
This version is static and uses files from Xeno-Canto that were downloaded in advanced. If you'd like to make custom API calls, then you can use [this version](https://github.com/Sal-Adrian/Canto-Avis-S) that requires a server and API key. This static version has more consistant performace and does not required setup.
